# Madeline's Dreamscape - Game Concept

## Overview
**Madeline's Dreamscape** is a narrative-driven platformer that combines the core gameplay mechanics of Hollow Knight (dash, platforming, combat) with the rich storytelling and branching dialogue system of Undertale.

## Core Gameplay Elements

### Movement & Combat (Hollow Knight-inspired)
- **Dash Mechanic**: Fast directional dash in 8 directions (inherited from Ectopaws)
- **Platforming**: Precise jumping and movement across varied terrain
- **Combat System**: Fight enemies encountered in different levels
- **Progression**: Explore interconnected levels with increasing difficulty

### Narrative & Choice System (Undertale-inspired)
- **Branching Storyline**: Player choices affect the narrative outcome
- **NPC Interactions**: Encounter characters throughout the game world
- **Dialogue Choices**: Make decisions that impact relationships and story
- **Consequence System**: Actions can trigger different outcomes (e.g., making an NPC angry triggers a fight)
- **Multiple Endings**: Different story conclusions based on player choices

## Art Style & Characters
- **Visual Design**: Based on Felix's Ectopaws characters from Assignment #3
- **Main Character**: Cat protagonist (Ectopaw)
- **Setting**: Madeline's Dreamscape - a surreal, dream-like world
- **NPCs**: Various characters with unique personalities and storylines
